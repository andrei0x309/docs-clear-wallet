# History Screen

<p class="pb-4">History screen lets you view the history of transactions you've sent ordered by date.</p>

<p class="pb-4">You can view the transaction hash, and you can click on it to open the transaction in the network explorer.</p>

<p class="pb-4">You can also wipe all the history from the list using the wipe button at the bottom.</p>

<p class="pb-4">For UX purposes history is limited to 100 transactions.</p>
