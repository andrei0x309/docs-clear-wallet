# Introduction

Clear EVM wallet is fully open-source EVM browser wallet based on Ethers, Ionic, Manifest V3, and Vue. It implements Metamask API and will work as a replacement for Metamask, websites will detect it as Metamask, so select metamask when interacting with Dapps.
Websites that implement EIP-6963 will detect it as Clear EVM Wallet.

It is public on Chrome Store since August 2022 link [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clear-evm-wallet-clw/djlahdpfkflehaepgohnnodmaajabdlg?hl=en&authuser=0).

## Benefits

### Fast

Is very light has no analytics, no ads, no trackers, no bloatware, very few dependencies.

### Good for devs

When you build something you might need to setup a wallet fast, this wallet can create/delete/import accounts very fast, it eliminates
steps that other wallets have like "create a password" or "write down your seed phrase", which means you can interact faster with your Dapps. It also has arbitrary read/write to contracts so you can use it to test your contracts.

### Is an niche wallet

Many viruses and malware are targeting Metamask, because it is the most popular wallet. So if you get infected they might try to get private keys from memory or from the storage. This wallet is relatively niche, so it has almost no chance of being directly targeted by malware.

### Has perma-lock

This wallet has a perma-lock feature, which means that private key is decripted every time you sign something, so you'll have to enter your password every time you sign something. This is a good security feature, as it harder to steal your private key from memory.

### Open source

You can check the code, you can build it yourself, you can contribute, you can report bugs, you can ask for features, it builds 
very fast in less than 10 seconds and does not require any prior environment setup.

### No ads

Unlike most wallets, this wallet has no ads, no analytics, no trackers, no bloatware, no telemetry, no data collection, no sponsored content, no sponsored Dapps, no sponsored tokens, no sponsored NFTs, no sponsored anything. It is a clean wallet with no revenue model, made by a single developer, if you want to support this project financially you can donate at andrei0x309.eth.

### Unique features

This wallet has unique features like: perma-lock, arbitrary read/write to contracts, very fast build time, wipe,
account import/export, import using derivation path, right click to paste current selected account address, directly open 
block explorers, and more.

### Privacy

This wallet goes to great lengths to protect your privacy. For me privacy is very important, so I made sure that this wallet does 
everything possible to protect your privacy. It does everything locally, it does not collect any data, it does not have any telemetry, it does not have any analytics, it does not have any ads, it does not have any trackers it does not have any sponsored content. When interacting with Daaps it will only provide the address for current selected account and not other data that might link you with other accounts in the wallet unlike other wallets.
