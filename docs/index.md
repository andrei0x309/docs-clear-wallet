## Benefits

### Fast

Is very light has no analytics, no ads, no trackers, no bloatware, very few dependencies.
### Good for devs

When you build something you might need to setup a wallet fast, this wallet can create/delete/import accounts very fast, it eliminates
steps that other wallets have like "create a password" or "write down your seed phrase", which means you can interact faster with your Dapps.

### Is an unknown wallet

Many viruses and malware are targeting Metamask, because it is the most popular wallet. So if you get infected they might try to get private keys from memory or from the storage. This wallet is relatively unknown, so it has almost no chance of being targeted by malware.

### Has perma-lock

This wallet has a perma-lock feature, which means that private key is decripted every time you sign something, so you'll have to enter your password every time you sign something. This is a good security feature, as it harder to steal your private key from memory.
