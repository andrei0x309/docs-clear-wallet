# Networks Screen

<p class="pb-4">Networks screen lets you manage your EVM networks.</p>

<p class="pb-4">You can add any network you want, and you can also select to add from a list of predefined networks templates.</p>

<p class="pb-4">All templates use main public RPC nodes, so you can quickly connect to a network without having to setup a node.</p>

<p class="pb-4">For advanced use is recommended to use a local node, or a third party provider you trust like Alchemy.</p>
